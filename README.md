## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript
- React.js

### What I learned

- Moving from Vanilla Javascript to React is sort of like learning to do weighted PullUps after mastering normal PullUps. Or learning to do declined PushUps after mastering normal PushUps. I enjoyed building this and learning a new method to reach a previously met goal.     

### Continued development

- More React apps!
